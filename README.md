    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

## üé® Customization

You can easily tweak the animation by changing the values in the `script.js` file:

* **Particle Count:** Change the `particleCount` variable to increase or decrease the density of the heart.
    ```javascript
    const particleCount = 4000; // Try 2000 or 8000
    ```

* **Colors & Glow:** Modify the `rgba` color values to change the hue and opacity of the particles and their glow.
    ```javascript
    ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 60, 60, 0.7)'; // Particle color
    ctx.shadowColor = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)';   // Glow color
    ```

* **Animation Speed:** Adjust the multiplier for the `time` variable inside the `animate` function to make the animation faster or slower.
    ```javascript
    const time = performance.now() * 0.0005; // Change 0.0005 to 0.001 for faster speed
    ```
